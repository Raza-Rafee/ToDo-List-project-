Purpose : 
This project is a web page that allows users to add and display book details. It features a form to input book information (title, author, description) and visually styled pop-up containers to showcase each book's details. Users can interact by adding new books, deleting entries, and viewing book details. The design is aesthetically pleasing, and JavaScript handles interactivity, including error prevention and a character limit for descriptions. The project provides a user-friendly interface for managing and presenting book information.



The web page includes the following key elements:
1. Title Bar:

  - The page has a title bar with the name "Booksky," styled with a plum background and a unique font.

2. Add Book Form:

  - The main functionality is centered around an "Add Book" form, which is initially hidden and appears when the user clicks the "+" button. 

  - The form includes input fields for the book title, author, and a textarea for a short description.

  - The form is styled with a pink background and a 40% width, centered on the page.

3. Pop-up Display for Book Details:

  - When a book is added, its details are displayed in a pop-up container with a black background.

  - The pop-up container includes the book title, author, and a short description.

  - Each pop-up container has a delete button ("Delete") styled with a brown background.

4. Styling and Layout:

  - The overall layout is responsive, with proper styling for fonts, colors, and spacing.

  - Different sections of the page have specific background colors, creating a visually appealing design.

5. JavaScript Functionality:

  - JavaScript functions are implemented for adding books, cancelling book addition, deleting pop-ups, and handling the display of the form and pop-up overlay.

6. Character Limit for Description:

  - The short description textarea has a character limit set to 1000 words. If a user exceeds this limit, the extra words are removed.

7. Error Handling:

  - The user is prompted to fill in all fields if they attempt to add a book without providing complete information.

8. Overlay:

  - A black overlay covers the entire page when the form or pop-up is displayed, providing a focus on the active elements.

In summary, this project combines functionality and aesthetics to create a user-friendly web page for adding and displaying book details.
